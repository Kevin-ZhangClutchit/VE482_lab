- **Where to copy the dice module for it to be officially known to the kernel?  ** 

  `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/dice`

- **What command to run in order to generate the `modules.dep` and `map` files?  **

  `depmod`

- **How to ensure the dice module is loaded at boot time, and how to pass it options?  **

  Create & Edit `/etc/modules-load.d/*.conf` & add `dicedevice gen_sides=` to pass parameters.

- **How to create a new `friends` group and add grandpa and his friends to it?  **[1]

  - Create a new `friends` group: `sudo groupadd friends`

- **What is `udev` and how to define rules such that the group and permissions are automatically setup at device creation?**

  - `udev` "provides a dynamic device directory containing only the files for actually present devices. It creates or removes device node files usually located in the /dev directory, or it renames network interfaces."[2]
  - create a rules file in `/etc/udev/rules.d/*.rules`, set `KERNEL=="DeviceName"` and `MODE=777`.
