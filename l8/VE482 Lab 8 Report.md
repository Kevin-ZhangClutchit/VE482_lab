## 2 Memory in Minix 3

### 2.1 Memory management at kernel level

- **What does `vm` stands for? (Hint: in this context the answer is not virtual machine)**

  Virtual Memory

- **Find the page table definition and search what fields each entry contain? **

  Page table is defined in `servers/vm/pt.h`:

  ```c
  /* A pagetable. */
  typedef struct {
  	/* Directory entries in VM addr space - root of page table.  */
  	u32_t *pt_dir;		/* page aligned (ARCH_VM_DIR_ENTRIES) */
  	u32_t pt_dir_phys;	/* physical address of pt_dir */
  
  	/* Pointers to page tables in VM address space. */
  	u32_t *pt_pt[ARCH_VM_DIR_ENTRIES];
  
  	/* When looking for a hole in virtual address space, start
  	 * looking here. This is in linear addresses, i.e.,
  	 * not as the process sees it but the position in the page
  	 * page table. This is just a hint.
  	 */
  	u32_t pt_virtop;
  } pt_t;
  ```

- **What basic functions are used to handle virtual memory?**

  To see the functions used to handle VM, we can check the main function of VM. Some basic functions are listed below:

  ```c
  /* Initialize system so that all processes are runnable */
  void init_vm(void);
  
  /* Register init callbacks. */
  void sef_setcb_init_restart(sef_cb_init_t cb);
  void sef_setcb_signal_handler(sef_cb_signal_handler_t cb);
  
  /* Let SEF perform startup. */
  void sef_startup();
  
  /* Check status */
  int sef_receive_status(endpoint_t src, message *m_ptr, int *status_ptr);
  int vm_isokendpt(endpoint_t endpoint, int *proc);
  static int vm_acl_ok(endpoint_t caller, int call);
  
  /* Map all the services in the boot image and return a result which is used to send reply message */
  static int do_rs_init(message *m);
  
  /* Handle pagefault */
  void do_pagefaults(message *m);
  void pt_clearmapcache(void);
  ```

- **Find all the places where the `vm` used inside the kernel, Why does it appear in so many different places?**

  `find /usr/src -name "*.c" | xargs grep -l "vm" > usage`

  ![image-20211124221821792](C:\Users\yexiaosu\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211124221821792.png)

  The file contains 299 lines, indicating 299 files using virtual memory. 

  Basically, when RAM is not enough, virtual memory will be used. Also, in MINIX3, process manager is split into  process management and memory management. So functions like `fork()` and `exit()` are implemented in VM, leading to so many usages of VM.

- **How is memory allocated within the kernel? Why are not `malloc` and `calloc` used?**

  By using `kmalloc()` or `vmalloc()` (allocate virtual memory).

  `malloc()` and `calloc()` are defined in user-space, so they cannot be used in kernel space (kernel can only use functions defined in kernel space). 

- **While allocating memory, how does the functions in kernel space switch back and forth between user and kernel spaces? How is that boundary crossed? How good or bad it is to put `vm` in userspace?**

  When `malloc()` is called in user space, it will see if there's a piece of unused memory that satisfy the allocation requirements. If not, it will call the kernel function `mmap()` to ask for some memory. Kernel will then allocates memory and allow the userspace process to map it into its address space with `mmap()`. User space process will then use what returned from `mmap()` to access that memory.

  I think it's a bad idea. Since the memory management needs to be done in kernel space, regrading to technique reasons and  safety reasons, if virtual memory is moved to user space, this means that the boundary between kernel space and user space will be crossed frequently, which is not a good idea.

- **How are pagefaults handled?** [[1]](https://elixir.ortiz.sh/minix/v3.2.1/source/servers/vm/main.c#L74) [[2]](https://elixir.ortiz.sh/minix/v3.2.1/source/servers/vm/pagefaults.c#L51) [[3]](https://elixir.ortiz.sh/minix/v3.2.1/source/kernel/system/do_vmctl.c#L19)

  Kernel sends the pagefault message through `pagefault()`. When VM receives the message in its `main()` function, it will call `do_pagefaults()` to handle it:

  ```c
  ...
  if(msg.m_type == RS_INIT && msg.m_source == RS_PROC_NR) {
      result = do_rs_init(&msg);
  } else if (msg.m_type == VM_PAGEFAULT) {
      if (!IPC_STATUS_FLAGS_TEST(rcv_sts, IPC_FLG_MSG_FROM_KERNEL)) {
          printf("VM: process %d faked VM_PAGEFAULT "
  					"message!\n", msg.m_source);
      }
      do_pagefaults(&msg);
      pt_clearmapcache();
      ...
  ```

  In `do_pagefaults()`, it checks whether the address is valid. If the process is writing, it will also check whether the memory is writable. After that, it sends signal back to kernel through `sys_vmctl()`.

  After kernel receives this signal, it calls `do_vmctl()` to handle it. It checks `VMCTL_CLEAR_PAGEFAULT` to ensure that the pagefault is already handled:

  ```c
  ...
  switch(m_ptr->SVMCTL_PARAM) {
  	case VMCTL_CLEAR_PAGEFAULT:
  		assert(RTS_ISSET(p,RTS_PAGEFAULT));
  		RTS_UNSET(p, RTS_PAGEFAULT);
  		return OK;
      ...
  ```

### 2.2 Mumâ€™s Really Unfair!

- **What algorithm is used by default in Minix 3 to handle pagefault? Find its implementation and study it closely.**

  Just as hinted by the introduction part, Minix3 use **LRU** algorithm to handle pagefault. The implementation is written in `/servers/vm/pagefault.c` in `Minix 3.2.1`.

  * `pf_errstr`: a function used to transfer the detected `err` to `char*`
  * `do_pagefaults`: 
    * this function first decode the input `message` to get the `endpoint`,`addr`&`err`
    * Then it first check whether the `endpoint` (the sender of the message) is valid.
    * After check `endpoint`, it checks whether the memory is valid, assert error if needed.
    * After checking whether memory is valid, if the process wants to `write` to the memory. Check whether the memory is writtable.
    * Then calculate the offset of memory.
    * After all these, handle the page fault accordingly and reactivate the process.
  * `do_memory`: parse the memory request. Check whether valid and call `handle_memory` if necessary.
  * `handle_memory`:
    * calculate the needed `page_size`
    * check the existence and the write access of the target memory.
    * allocate the memory and update necessary informations.

- **Use the top command to keep track of your used memory and cache, then run `time grep -r "mum" /usr/src`. Run the command again. What do you notice?**

  * First time: 8.01 real 0.25 user 5.00 sys
  * Second time: 2.45 real 0.73 user 1.71 sys
  * Notice: The `real` time & `sys` time drops dramatically while the `usr` time increases. As the search has just been carried out, due to `LRU` algorithm, it will replace an oldest page and when we carried out the second search, as it was cached, the search speed will be much faster and no need to handle more `page fault`, system time decreases.

- **Adjust the implementation of LRU into MRU and recompile the kernel.**

  * Replace almost all the `oldest` with `youngest` in `free_yielded`

  * In `lmfs_get_block`, replace `front` with `rear`

  * recompile the kernel

    ```shell
    cd /usr/src
    make build
    reboot
    ```

- **Use the top command to keep track of your used memory and cache, then run `time grep -r "mum" /usr/src`. Run the command again. What do you notice?**

  - First time: 32.41 real 0.21 user 13.03 sys
  - Second time: 29.56 real 0.58 user 11.76 sys
  - Notice: The First time search is very very very slow compared to the `LRU` implementation. In the Second time, the running speed speed up to a very limited sense due to the property of `MRU` will replace the most recently updated page. As the most recently used page are replaced, doing repeated tasks won't increase.

- **Discuss the different behaviours of LRU and MRU as well as the consequences**

  * `LRU` replaces the least-recently-used pages while `MRU` will replace the most-recently-used pages. In most situation, due to locality and spatial locality, `LRU` will be better. But under the following situation, I think `MRU` will be better:
  * In video website, after the user have finished one video, it is less likely for them to see it again in a short time. Then `MRU` will be better. [[4]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5088128/why-does-cache-use-most-recently-used-mru-algorithm-as-evict-policy)
